Dear POTENTIAL partners,

I would like to share with you some insights from the **Project Final Review Meeting**, which took place on Thursday, 27 November with the Work Package Leads, Use Case Leads, and the SPOCs from each Member State.  
The session was held with the evaluators from the European Commission: **HaDEA**, **DG CNECT**, and the two external experts appointed by the Commission, **Anders Törnqvist** (Comfact AB) and **Alberto Zanini** (Azienda Regionale per l’Innovazione e gli Acquisti S.p.A.).

This meeting marked an important milestone. It provided an opportunity to reflect on two and a half years of collective work, to present concrete results supported by demonstrations, and to engage directly with the Commission and the experts. These exchanges complemented the extensive written material already submitted through the project deliverables and the many interactions held with the Commission throughout the project.  

We also conveyed the position expressed by several stakeholders regarding the importance of maintaining stability in the regulatory framework, in particular following the announcement of the reopening of the first batch of implementing acts for which an agreement had previously been reached.

We are pleased to report that the feedback from the evaluators was **very positive**. They highlighted:

• the significant progress achieved during the project,  
• the essential role of the Large Scale Pilots and POTENTIAL’s key contribution to the development of the **European Digital Identity Wallet (EUDIW)**,  
• the added value of the **interoperability tests** organised by the consortium, noting their strong wish for these events to be continued and taken as an example in the future, including for standardisation bodies.

Over the coming weeks, the evaluators will consolidate their assessment into an official report based on the project deliverables and the final report. As part of this process, some adjustments or requests for clarification may be addressed to specific partners. We thank you in advance for your cooperation during this final evaluation phase.

We would like to express once again our warm appreciation for your commitment and the high quality of collaboration throughout the duration of POTENTIAL.

As 2025 draws to a close, we wish you **happy end-of-year holidays**.  
The year **2026 will be a decisive year for the European Digital Identity Wallet**, and we look forward to continuing this important journey with you in the upcoming initiatives.
