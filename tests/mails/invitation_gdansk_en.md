Dear POTENTIAL partners,

I hope this message finds you well.

We have received an invitation from the Centre for Information Technology and the Polish Ministry of Digital Affairs to attend an upcoming event titled **“European Business Wallets – Enabling Burden Reduction and Empowering Businesses,”** which will take place on **June 16th, 2025**, in Gdańsk, Poland. The event will explore the European Business Wallet through a set of engaging workshops—one large session in the morning and three smaller ones in the afternoon. This will be an excellent opportunity for stakeholders to contribute, learn, and network in the context of digital innovation and trust services.

Due to limited capacity (170 participants), **priority will be given to SMEs, EUDIW experts, trust service providers, and public administration representatives** who are able to actively participate in the workshops. **Please find the invitation and agenda attached for your reference.**

If you or your colleagues are interested in attending, we encourage you to register promptly, given the limited availability.

Should you have any questions or require additional information, please do not hesitate to reach out.

Best regards,
