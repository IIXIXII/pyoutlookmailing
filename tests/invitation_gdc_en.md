Dear All,
 
The Open Wallet Foundation is organizing the **Global Digital Collaboration Conference** on **July 1-2, 2025 in Geneva**, at the _Centre International de Conf√©rences Gen√®ve (CICG)_ üìç.
 
This conference is particularly significant, coinciding with the conclusion of the first round of LSPs and the finalization of the eIDAS 2.0 implementing acts. As eIDAS continues to evolve, this gathering offers a critical platform for global collaboration. High-level representatives from the EU, China, US, Japan, India, Trinidad & Tobago, and other regions will convene to discuss essential use cases such as driver‚Äôs licenses, healthcare, payments, and travel.

We believe this event is a pivotal opportunity to foster collaboration across borders and shape the future of digital identity on a global scale. It is essential to bring together key actors at this crucial stage to enhance mutual understanding and cooperation.
