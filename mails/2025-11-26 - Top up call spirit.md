<!-- var(subject)="[Top up call] Accelerating Together: Consortium Approach for the 2026 EUDI Wallet Milestones" -->
<!-- var(summary)="EUDI Wallet Milestones" -->
<!-- var(role)="" -->
Dear all,

Following the recent Steering Committees and the exchanges we have had with many of you, we would like to share with the entire consortium the overall philosophy guiding the proposal, as well as the logic behind each Work Package. This message also highlights several elements that have evolved since earlier discussions and which will need to be collectively reviewed and validated.

At political level, the European Commission has reaffirmed the strategic importance of ensuring that **all Member States can issue a certified EU Digital Identity Wallet by the end of 2026**, as highlighted in the recent letter from Director-General Roberto Viola. The Commission expects each Member State to prioritise wallet development, reinforce cross-border cooperation, and align certification efforts. This call is therefore meant to remove obstacles, accelerate readiness, and ensure coherence across Europe.

In this context, the consortium has been deliberately designed to remain lean and operational. A complex structure would risk diverting resources at a moment where Member States and private partners are already heavily mobilised. The proposal therefore focuses on what is essential: wallet construction, certification, interoperability, and practical support to all Member States.

### WP1 – Governance & Wallet Development  
**Objective: establish a coordinated framework and steer the construction of national wallets.**

WP1 is oriented towards the **development and operational preparation of the wallet**, and includes:
- the **wallet providers**,  
- the **authorities responsible for wallet issuance**,  
- the **entities formally in charge of designating or appointing wallet providers**.

WP1 coordinates wallet development progress, technical readiness, alignment with the ARF and implementing acts, and the preparation for certification prerequisites.

In addition, and following recent exchanges, **WP1 would also include the preparation work related to the certification of the Commission’s reference implementation**. This represents an evolution compared to previous discussions and should therefore be reviewed together.

WP1 also carries the coordination backbone: planning, monitoring, sustainability strategy and high-level communication.

### WP2 – Sandbox  
**Objective: provide a shared environment to test, validate and strengthen interoperability.**

WP2 offers each Member State an environment to:
- test functionalities,  
- validate interoperability,  
- and prepare their wallet for certification.

This includes structured testing cycles, interoperability events and plugfests.

### WP3 – Certification  
**Objective: develop and align national certification schemes and prepare the certification ecosystem.**

WP3 is entirely dedicated to certification and includes:
- National Cybersecurity Certification Authorities (NCCAs),  
- Conformity Assessment Bodies (CABs),  
- accreditation bodies where appropriate.

WP3 covers the development, validation and alignment of certification schemes.  
It remains strictly separated from development activities to ensure neutrality and integrity.

### WP4 – Support & Modular Components  
**Objective: deliver reusable components and provide tailored support to Member States.**

WP4 has two missions:
1. **Producing modular wallet components**, including mDL (Annex A), Remote HSM and additional components proposed by Member States.  
2. **Providing targeted support**, through a cascade funding mechanism to assist Member States requiring specific expertise or resources.

This WP no longer includes the certification of the reference implementation, following adjustments made during the latest discussions.

### WP5 – Standardisation  
**Objective: ensure convergence of interpretations and avoid fragmentation.**

WP5 harmonises technical and regulatory positions to support consistent implementation across Member States and alignment with the evolving European framework.

### Consortium Name – A Friendly Challenge

One last point, on a lighter note: we will also need to **choose a name for the consortium**. The “naming competition” is now officially open.  
As a first suggestion, I would propose **EUDI Wallet Readiness**.

Other possible options could include:
- **EUDI Ready**  
- **EUDI Core**  
- **EUDI Align**  

Feel free to propose your own ideas — all contributions are welcome.

### Conclusion

All these elements – in particular the adjusted roles between WP1 and WP4 – represent proposals meant to support the best possible structure for this call. They require discussion and confirmation by the consortium.

We will review this structure together during the next Steering Committee on **Friday at 11:30**. This meeting will allow us to confirm the roles, align expectations and ensure readiness for the preparation phase ahead.

As the Commission has emphasised, the coming months represent a true race to deliver certified, interoperable and operational European Digital Identity Wallets by the end of 2026. Our collective capacity to coordinate effectively and support one another will determine our success.

We look forward to discussing this with all of you on Friday.

<br/>Warm regards,
