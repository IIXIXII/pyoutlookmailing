Dear all,

The European Digital Identity Wallet (EUDIW) is becoming increasingly tangible. Technical specifications are maturing, national implementations are gaining momentum, and the deadlines set at the European level are fast approaching. The time has come to move from preparation to execution.

To succeed, we must now bring together an ecosystem that is as broad and inclusive as possible. The Large Scale Pilots (LSPs) have laid valuable groundwork, but many key players — service providers, attribute issuers, wallet developers, relying parties — remain outside these formal pilots. These actors now need opportunities to test interoperability, identify compatible partners, and begin building meaningful, user-facing use cases.

This is the purpose of **EUDIW Unfold**: to bring the ecosystem together and launch this next phase of collective work.

The **morning session** will focus on the overall EUDIW architecture and provide a lively, interactive overview of the current state of play across European implementations. Beyond information-sharing, it will feature **live demos** and a few surprises designed to spark ideas, foster collaboration, and offer a concrete sense of how the ecosystem is taking shape.

The **afternoon session** will dive into the **age verification use case**, offering a practical lens on implementation.

This **first edition** of EUDIW Unfold is **dedicated to technology providers**. Future sessions will be organised for relying parties and credential issuers.

You are warmly invited to join us for the **official launch of EUDIW Unfold – the ecosystem chapter**:
