Dear all,

I hope you are doing well.

As part of the preparation for the next Multiannual Financial Framework (2028-2034), the European Commission has launched several surveys to gather valuable insights on EU investment needs in digital technologies. These surveys aim to shape the future of research, innovation, and deployment in this field.

The surveys are part of two ongoing studies, in preparation of the next Multiannual Financial Framework (2028-2034):

-   One on the [research, development, and innovation](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/activities/study-identify-digital-technologies-next-eu-research-and-innovation-fund) of strategic digital technologies beyond 2027
-   Another on the [deployment](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/activities/study-eus-critical-digital-capacities-deployment-beyond-2027) (integration, application, and roll-out) of digital technologies and infrastructures, as well as related skills development.

The following surveys have been launched:
