Dear Partner,  

Following the momentum of **EUDIW Unfold #1**, where we committed to organizing targeted and hands-on sessions, **age verification** quickly emerged as one of the most tangible and widely relevant use cases for the **European Digital Identity Wallet (EUDIW)**.  

We are therefore pleased to invite you to a **dedicated interop workshop** focused on testing and showcasing how EUDIW-compliant wallets and verifiers can support **proof-of-age scenarios**, both nationally and across borders.  

This session will provide a concrete opportunity to:  
- Test interoperability between wallet and verifier implementations;  
- Explore different formats and methods for age-related credentials (e.g. *“over 18”*, *“over 21”*);  
- Examine approaches to selective disclosure, offline/online modes, and user experience design;  
- Gather technical feedback to support convergence across pilots and beyond;  
- Share lessons learned and identify blockers to adoption.  

We welcome participation from **wallet providers**, **verifier developers**, **service providers**, **LSPs**, and **independent contributors** who wish to test, observe, or learn from real interactions.
