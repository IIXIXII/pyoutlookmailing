Dear partners,

We would like to thank you once again for your continued involvement and for the constructive exchanges we have had over the past weeks. As we move forward with the preparation of our joint proposal, we wish to keep you informed of the latest developments and the next steps.

We are pleased to confirm that the European Commission has officially granted the extension request. The new submission deadline is now set for **15 January 2026**. This additional time will allow us to finalise the organisational aspects of the consortium and consolidate both the technical and financial components of the proposal.

Regarding the consortium name, and following the numerous suggestions received, we propose to organise one final voting round including the latest proposals. This will allow all partners to express their preference before confirming the official name of the consortium.

Concerning the budget, and in line with the discussions held during the last Steering Committee, it has been agreed that wallet providers will be removed from Work Package 3, to reflect more accurately the nature of certification activities. A revised version of the budget will be uploaded to the Nextcloud in the coming days and will serve as the new basis for consolidation.

In preparation for the next phase, we invite all Work Package Leaders to organise internal working sessions in the coming weeks to further define the technical scope and expected activities of each WP. Early alignment will be essential to ensure a coherent and mature proposal by mid-January.

We also propose to hold **Steering Committee n°5 on Thursday, 11 December at 14:00**. The invitation will be shared shortly.

Until then, we kindly remind all partners that we are still expecting **the budget templates** — including at minimum the applicable national rates — as well as **the ownership control declarations** for the relevant entities. These documents remain necessary to progress with the administrative and financial assembly of the proposal.

We thank you in advance for your cooperation and timely contributions, which are essential for keeping the consortium on track. We will keep you informed as soon as new information becomes available, in particular regarding the updated budget files and the final naming vote.

<br/>Best regards,
