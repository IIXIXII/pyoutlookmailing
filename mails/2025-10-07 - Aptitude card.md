Dear Participants,  

As part of the **Aptitude Consortium Kick-off**, each participant will receive a **personalised Member Card** identifying them as a member of the consortium.  

All registered participants will shortly receive an email from the **Nexus platform**.  
Please follow the link provided in that email and complete your registration by entering the requested information (name, family name, photo, etc.).  

This will allow you to personalise your card and ensure it is ready for collection at the registration desk during the event in Paris.

### About the Aptitude Member Card Experience  

This initiative is more than just a badge: it’s the beginning of a **hands-on experiment** exploring the bridge between **physical credentials and digital credentials**.  

In collaboration with the **Imprimerie Nationale**, we will issue **physical consortium cards** that will serve as badges for all in-person meetings and events. These cards represent your **official status as a member of the Aptitude consortium**, and at the same time, they are part of a broader experiment that will evolve throughout the project.  

On the back of each card, you will find a **QR code built according to the ISO 22376:2023 standard**, containing both an **integrity proof** and an **authorship proof**.  
This same technology is already used in France for official credentials such as **boating licences**, which can be securely imported into the **France Identité** wallet without relying on any centralised database.  

Similarly, for the **Aptitude Member Card**, there will be **no centralised database** for verifying membership rights.  
Over the next **24 months**, we will collectively explore how this credential can be **digitally issued and imported into various wallets**, testing new forms of **trust and interoperability** between the physical and digital worlds.  

This small but meaningful experiment will help us better understand how **physical titles and digital credentials** can complement and reinforce one another: an essential step in shaping the future of European digital identity.  

If you would like to take part in the **wallet import tests**, please contact:

We look forward to seeing you soon in Paris — and to launching this exciting journey together!
