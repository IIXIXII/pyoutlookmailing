Dear APTITUDE partners,  

Following the official start of the **APTITUDE project** on October 1st, and in view of our **Kick-off Meeting in Paris on October 22–23**, we would like to share a few key reminders and useful resources available to all partners.  

## 1. Project Management and Coordination  

The coordination team is composed of:  
- **ANTS**, supported by **Wavestone**, responsible for overall project coordination and monitoring;  
- **CIVIPOL**, in charge of financial management.  
- CIVIPOL will shortly communicate further details regarding the **pre-financing received from the European Commission**.  

To ensure smooth coordination between the project team and all participants, the coordinator relies on **Single Points of Contact (SPOCs)** — one per Member State — who serve as the main liaison between the coordination team and national partners.  
Information is distributed by the coordination team to SPOCs, who then relay it to their national partners. SPOCs also communicate back to the coordination team any relevant topics or requests raised at national level.  

## 2. Resources Available to Participants  

All project documentation and collaborative resources are accessible via the [**Nextcloud**](https://cloud2.digital-identity-wallet.eu/apps/dashboard/) platform, including:  
- The [**project contact list**](https://cloud2.digital-identity-wallet.eu/s/mNGaxbiARg7nxDX), which each entity is kindly asked to keep up to date to support efficient communication across partners;  
- The [**Grant Agreement**](https://cloud2.digital-identity-wallet.eu/s/KKjrGWKxWcSdgEc) and [**Consortium Agreement**](https://cloud2.digital-identity-wallet.eu/s/zQLpydwyqnAK97o).  
  - We are currently setting up an **electronic signature tool** to facilitate and secure the signing process for entities that have not yet signed the Consortium Agreement.  
  - Should this delay create any issue for your organization, you may alternatively **sign the document manually** and return the signed copy to the coordination team.  

In addition, a [**Slack channel**](https://join.slack.com/t/aptitude-consortium/shared_invite/zt-3f4rbdrxh-V23gkMZdnNMfZM0KLa6Qcg) has been created to support more direct and spontaneous exchanges among partners.  

We strongly encourage all partners to make active use of these tools to stay aligned and ensure smooth collaboration throughout the project.  

We look forward to meeting you all in Paris later this month for the **official kick-off meeting**.  
If your organization has not yet registered, please follow this [**registration link**](https://luma.com/tgks1886).  

<br/>Best regards,
