Dear all,  

We are delighted by the strong interest in the upcoming **EUDIW Unfold** meeting on **September 10th, 2025**, and we sincerely thank you for registering.  

Due to the very high number of on-site registrations (over 120 for a room with a capacity of 60), we are currently reviewing attendance to ensure a smooth and comfortable experience for everyone.  

If you are able to join us **online**, we kindly invite you to consider switching to **remote participation**. The online format will provide **full access** to the event, including:  
- Live streaming of all sessions  
- Interactive tools  
- The possibility to ask questions in real time  

To change your participation mode, please **inform Anthony Carmoy, who is in copy of this email**. 

Of course, we will accommodate specific situations, such as already booked travel arrangements or other constraints. If this applies to you, please feel free to reach out to us directly.  

Thank you very much for your understanding and cooperation. We look forward to welcoming you — in Paris or online — for this important milestone in the EUDIW journey.  

Warm regards,  
<br/>
