Dear Partner,  

Following the momentum of **EUDIW Unfold #1**, where we committed to organizing targeted sessions for key sectors, it became clear that the **banking and payments ecosystem** deserves dedicated attention.  

We are therefore pleased to invite you to a **half-day workshop** focused on how the **European Digital Identity Wallet (EUDIW)** can support **Strong Customer Authentication (SCA)** and address the **new regulatory requirements for IBAN verification**.  

This session will provide a concrete opportunity to:  
- Examine how the wallet can streamline SCA processes and enhance user experience in online banking;  
- Explore the potential of EUDIW for IBAN validation, in light of the upcoming obligation to verify the link between account holder and IBAN;  
- Gather feedback from financial institutions, payment service providers, and technical actors on implementation needs and priorities;  
- Share updates on technical readiness and ongoing pilots related to the financial sector.
