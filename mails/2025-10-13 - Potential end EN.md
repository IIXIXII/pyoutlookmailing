Dear partners,

September 30th marked the official end of the **POTENTIAL** project.  

On this occasion, I would like to express my **warm thanks** for your commitment and the remarkable work achieved throughout these two and a half years of collaboration.  

Thanks to your sustained efforts, especially during the last few months with the **testing activities** and **interoperability events**, we were able to **meet the project’s objectives** and **leave behind a valuable legacy** for the next _Large Scale Pilots_ supported by the European Commission.  

The lessons learned from POTENTIAL will directly contribute to the **consolidation and deployment of the European Digital Identity Wallet (EUDI Wallet)** and will continue to inspire future developments in this field.  

We are now entering the **administrative closure phase** of the project.  
This means finalising the **final report** and preparing for the **evaluation meeting** with the European Commission, scheduled for **27 November**. During this session, the coordination team, SPOCs, WPLs, and UCLs will present the results achieved.  

If you wish to follow the evaluation meeting remotely, we can provide you with a **Teams connection link**.  

During this final and crucial stage for the proper closure of the project, we rely on your cooperation to **submit your financial statements to CIVIPOL**, and for partners claiming more than **€325,000 of EU contribution**, the corresponding **Certificate on Financial Statements (CFS)**.  

Based on these inputs, the European Commission will calculate the **final grant amount**, which will be disbursed to the project after the evaluation by its experts, **during the first quarter of 2026**.  
CIVIPOL, as for previous payments, will then ensure the **redistribution to each participant**.  

Once again, thank you very much for your **commitment** and **cooperation** throughout this journey.  

We look forward to continuing our collaboration in **future European projects**!
