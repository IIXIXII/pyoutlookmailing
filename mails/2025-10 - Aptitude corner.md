- Engage with over 200 decision-makers from European and international public and private organizations,  
- Connect directly with key players in the travel industry (hospitality, aviation, rail) and in the payments sector (major banks and financial institutions),  
- Boost your visibility in an environment designed to foster high-level networking.  

As availability is limited, we kindly invite you to confirm your interest by replying to this email. For all practical and financial details, please contact:
