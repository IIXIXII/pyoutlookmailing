Dear all,

We are pleased to inform you that the **EUDIW PACT** proposal has now been successfully submitted on the European Commission platform.

For your information, you will find the submitted proposal attached.

Please note that this version does not constitute a final or fixed description of all project elements. As is customary, further refinements and adjustments may take place during the Grant Agreement Preparation phase. This phase will also allow, where appropriate, for the use of the available budgetary flexibility.

Beyond this important milestone, we are collectively entering a decisive phase. **2026 is shaping up to be the year of the European Digital Identity Wallet**: the year when design choices become operational reality, when certification meets deployment, and when coordination between Member States turns into concrete availability for citizens. The alignment of calendars, regulations and collective efforts gives this year a very particular momentum.

We would like to sincerely thank all partners for their strong engagement and valuable contributions throughout the preparation phase. Within a demanding timeframe, we made every effort to accommodate expectations and inputs while ensuring overall coherence and compliance with the call requirements.

Thank you once again for the constructive collaboration and collective commitment. We will keep you informed as soon as we receive feedback or next steps from the Commission.

Kind regards,
