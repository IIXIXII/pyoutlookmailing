Dear all,  

On the eve of our **Aptitude Kick-off meeting**, I wanted to share how much I am looking forward to welcoming you all **tomorrow in Paris**.  

Over the next two days, we will have the opportunity to **officially launch our joint work**, exchange ideas, and shape together the **future of digital identity in Europe**.  

This meeting marks the beginning of a **new and exciting journey**, one that builds on the achievements of *Potential* and looks ahead to the **real-life implementation of the EUDI Wallet**.  

I am particularly grateful to all partners for the **energy, commitment, and cooperation** that have already made this project possible.  

👉 *You will also find attached a short PowerPoint document designed to help you create an image for social media.*  

Simply fill in the **last slide with your name, role, and organization**, then **export it as a PNG** — the instructions are included in the file.  

I wish you all **safe travels to Paris** and look forward to seeing you tomorrow for what promises to be two **inspiring and productive days**.  

<br/>Warm regards,
