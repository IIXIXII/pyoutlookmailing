Dear Aptitude partners,

As many of us prepare to take a well-deserved summer break, I would like to warmly thank you once again for your strong engagement in building the project proposal in response to the European Commission’s call, and for completing all the administrative and contractual steps following the selection of our initiative.

Thanks to this joint effort, **we have now reached a key milestone: the signing of the Grant Agreement by the European Commission**, officially launching our project.

While we are currently finalising the last remaining beneficiary signatures, we will also proceed with the **electronic signature of the Consortium Agreement** in the coming weeks. This will ensure a smooth **operational start of the project in October**.

In parallel, our collaboration with our Greek colleagues from WP8L has led to the creation of the project’s visual identity. I’m pleased to share with you the **official Aptitude logo** below, which you are welcome to use in your communications related to the project:

We are also preparing the **kick-off meeting**, which will take place at the **end of October in Paris**. More information will be shared with you by the end of August.

I look forward to working together on shaping the future of digital identity in Europe through interoperable digital identity wallets and their use cases.

Wishing you all a relaxing and enjoyable summer break.

Warm regards,  

<br/>
