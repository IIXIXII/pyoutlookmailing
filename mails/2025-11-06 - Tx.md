Dear all,  

We would like to thank you for your participation in the **Aptitude consortium Kick-off**, held in **Paris on 22–23 October 2025**.  

These two days were a key moment to bring the consortium together, align on the project’s objectives and organisation, and share first insights on the upcoming work across the different Work Packages.  

Your **active involvement** during the plenary sessions and workshops greatly contributed to the quality of the discussions and to setting a **solid foundation for the months ahead**.  
The exchanges confirmed the **strong engagement and expertise** within the consortium, which will be essential to Aptitude’s success.
